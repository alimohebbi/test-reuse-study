Gator Program Analysis Toolkit For Android

This release (version 3.3) includes the source code for the static
analyses described in our CGO'14, ICSE'15, ASE'15 and CC16 papers.
In order to provide a clearer description of this tool, we rewrite
the documentation and it is located in the 'docs' directory.

The directory structure is as follows:

- README: this file

- LICENSE: license for the software components developed at OSU: (1)
  GATOR, and (2) accompanying scripts to run the analysis.

- SootAndroid: source code for the static analysis component of GATOR,
  including work from CGO'14 and ASE'15, as well as various extensions
  and bug fixes.

- AndroidBench: Android programs used in our experiments, and
  associated Android platform JAR files. Note: In order to reduce the
  download size, we only include one Android program (APV) in this
  archive (gator-3.3). The remaining 19 Android programs used in both
  CGO'14 and ASE'15 papers can be downloaded from a separate archive
  bench-3.3 at http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/presto/software/gator/

- docs: The documentation of GATOR
